// Count-based worktree retention (#483). A busy cockpit leaves one full repo
// checkout per finished task under `.ai/cezar/worktrees/<runId>`; nothing bounds
// the total, so disk saturates. This module decides *which* finished worktrees
// to reclaim (directory only — the `cez/<id8>` branch is kept, so the work stays
// recoverable). The selector here is pure and unit-testable; the I/O enforcer
// that actually calls `removeWorktree` lives beside it in `retention-enforce.ts`.
